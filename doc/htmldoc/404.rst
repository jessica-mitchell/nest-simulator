Note that NEST only maintains the current and previous 2 releases, this includes documentation.

If you think the page should exist, you can `create a GitHub issue <https://github.com/nest/nest-simulator/issues/new/choose>`_.

If you really need an older version, you can look at the `GitHub repository <https://github.com/nest/nest-simulator/tags>`_  for previous
tags of our releases for that versioned documentation.

You can also :ref:`contact the developer team <mail_guidelines>` for support.
